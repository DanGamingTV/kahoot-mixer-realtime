# kahoot-mixer-realtime

**This project allows you to watch a mixer stream and participate in the kahoot game at the same time, on the same page. This is useful for mobile users that can't have multiple tabs open simultaneously.**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Installing for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Installing

Clone the project or download it as zip into a directory. Once done, run index.html in your browser by double clicking the file. Afterwards, stream to mixer from OBS using the "FLL: Mixer" preset.

In OBS, you want to have a screen capture of your browser, that has the kahoot question board in it.
Just link this up to a website, and (optionally) display your website url in the stream, so those watching can go directly to your website and play along in real time.

## Modification of files

Edit index.html and change "https://mixer.com/embed/player/DanGamingTV?disableLowLatency=0&disableLinks=1&hideChannel=1" to "https://mixer.com/embed/player/YOURCHANNELHERE?disableLowLatency=0&disableLinks=1&hideChannel=1"
YOURCHANNELHERE = Your mixer username
