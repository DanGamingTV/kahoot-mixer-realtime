Stream to mixer from OBS using the "FLL: Mixer" preset.
In OBS, you want to have a screen capture of your browser, that has the kahoot question board in it.
Just link this up to a website, and (optionally) display your website url in the stream, so those watching can go directly to your website and play along in real time.
